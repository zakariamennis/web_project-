    <h1> Hi welcome to this contry:</h1>

    <p3>Morocco, mountainous country of western North Africa that lies directly across the Strait of Gibraltar from Spain.
    The traditional domain of indigenous peoples now collectively known as Berbers (self-name Imazighen; 
    singular, Amazigh), Morocco has been subject to extensive migration and has long been the location of urban communities that were originally settled by peoples from outside the region.
    Controlled by Carthage from an early date, the region was later the westernmost province of the Roman Empire. Following the Arab conquest of the late 7th century ce, the broader area of North Africa came to be known as the Maghrib (Arabic: “the West”),
    and the majority of its people accepted Islam. Subsequent Moroccan kingdoms enjoyed political influence that extended beyond the coastal regions, and in the 11th century the first native Amazigh dynasty of North Africa

    <h1> Land:</h1>
    <p>Morocco borders Algeria to the east and southeast, Western Sahara to the south, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. 
    It is the only African country with coastal exposure to both the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Its area—excluding the territory of Western Sahara, which Morocco controls—is slightly larger than the U.S. state of California.
    Two small Spanish enclaves, Ceuta and Melilla, hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhare situated on the country’s northern coast</p>
